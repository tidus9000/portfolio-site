## A 64 local multiplayer game

Kachiku64 is potentially the most ambitious project that I have been a part of making and with the largest team I have worked with as a whole. The idea was conceived as a large scale local multiplayer game that could be played with up to 64 players.

This was a large scale group project shared across the entire year cohort of nearly 40 students. When work began for us, there was already a lot of groundwork done, our job was to improve upon it and have the game in a state ready for release.

My team were responsible for the creation of customisation options. This would be game settings that could be saved and changed but also playlists of particular game modes and levels.

As project manager for my team of 6, my job was to ensure communication between other teams was made easy and making sure that my team was on track with it's objectives. This was on top of my own duties within the team to work on the specific systems.
