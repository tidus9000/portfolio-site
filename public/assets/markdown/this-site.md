# My Portfolio site
## A place to get to know and find out all about me!

The site you are on right now has been completely built from the ground up by me using Vite, React and programmed in Typescript.

While the site itself is barebones, I was sick of using website designers like squarespace and Wix which all looked the same and very generic to me. So I took it upon myself to step out of my usual comfort zone of game engines and C based programming languages and into the world of web development to build things myself. The source code is available on my git page below along with any of the other projects in my portfolio that have been made public.
