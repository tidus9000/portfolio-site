# Shell Corp

#### A 1-8 player physics based egg-centric party game where you control, paint, and crack eggs!

Shell Corp was the first full commercial product I worked on. The game is a 1-8 player multiplayer party experience developed for Xbox One, Windows and Mac.

My work on this was mainly that of a Producer with with various aspects of programming. I headed up the formation of our company Practical Yolk Games and did a lot of outreach to publishers and friends within the industry. Through my initiatives, we gained Xbox One Dev kits as part of the ID@Xbox program and organised getting the game on to Steam. I also secured us booth space at PAX X EGX Online.

On the development side, I wore many hats while I was also studying my MSc in Commercial Games Development. I did aspects of shader programming, initial console development and the development of a multiplatform Achievement which I had interacting with both Steam Achievements and Xbox Achievements.

We released Shell Corp on Steam on the 21st of August 2020 to a SteamDB rating of 70.57%. A demo of the game is available if you want to try it!
