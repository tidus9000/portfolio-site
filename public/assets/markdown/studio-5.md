# Studio 5

#### A base to host virtual live events through the use of pioneering technology to livestream volumetric video

Studio 5 was a project stemming from my first job after attaining my masters degree. The company I worked at, Condense, specialised in livestreaming volumetric video technology and Studio 5 was a Windows and web browser app developed to enable music artists to perform live shows using our technology.

Volumetric video, is technology that is slowly being used more and more by large studios Including Disney. What it involves is similar to doing a 3D scan of an object or person by taking multiple photos in an instant from hundreds of angles. What Volumetric video does is use this concept but as a video rather than a single snapshot, so multiple photos from multiple angles at a rate of up to 30 frames per second. The technology itself is not new but where most studios would require weeks or even months to process the images and depth data, at Condense we got this processing time down to less than 10 seconds. Allowing us to live stream 3D scanned video of performers and put them into our game.

being a small team, I had to wear a lot of hats over my 4 years working at Condense and on Studio 5. I was in charge of a lot of core development including networking and the managing of various different venues within the app. I was also in charge of many aspects of the steam backend for the game and liaising with the marketing team to organise the Steam store page and updates. From here I moved on to tools development and led the development of our Unity editor plugin: The Venue builder. This was a set of tools that allowed level designers to design custom venues for hosting live events in Studio 5 and gave them the ability to interact with our backend systems to set up events and parameters that allowed them to change aspects of their venue remotely in real time via our web app.

The windows version of Studio 5 is still available on steam for free with a recording of one of our previous shows.
