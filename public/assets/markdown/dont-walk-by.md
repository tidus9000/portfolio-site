# Don't Walk By

#### A serious game designed to help teach workplace health and safety in a fun and engaging way.

Don't walk by was a large group project done by 10 masters students over the course of 4 months. The gameplay revolves around esuring the safe evacuation of a crowded building in the event of an emergency such as a fire.

My work involved a lot of the aspects around the crowd AI and how each member of a crowdreacts to different obstacles and hazards. Along with this, I tackeled level design aspects and was able to draw on my experience on Shell Corp for the writing of a commercial report.
