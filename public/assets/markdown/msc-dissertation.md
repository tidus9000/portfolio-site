# Developing a Novel Method for Making Music Interactive in Video Games

#### A dissertation report investigating the impact of adding rhythm timing elements to a variety of game genres

For my Masters Degree in Commecial Games Development, I wrote my dissertation on the impact of adding elements of rhythm timing to 3 different prototypes that were developed in a short time. This involved me learning new tools in FMod Studio and creating a series of new tools which could rapidly implement such gameplay elements in a short amount of time. The full text of the report along with a demonstration video is available below.
