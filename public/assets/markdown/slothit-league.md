# Slothit League

## A demake of Rocket League for the Atari 2600
Slothit League was a game created with the intention of being a representation of how our team though the modern game "Rocket League" would be made for the Atari 2600. This project had a lot of dedication to recreating the look and feel of the Atari 2600, not just through colour pallets and audio limitations but even down to haw the image was rendered on screen, where we emulated the original output resolution of the 2600 being stretched out on a tv screen, as would have originally happened.

We even created a manual for the game with a back story and a tick box list of achievements to really add to the Atari 2600 aesthetic.
