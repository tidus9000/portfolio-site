# Dan's Mission of Transmission

## A puzzle game that's all about listening

Dan's Mission of Transmission was â€‹my first attempt at participating in the Global Game Jam. For GGJ 2018, the theme given was "Transmission". From this, we cam up with the idea for Dan's Mission of Transmission.

You are Dan, the worlds greatest hacker. Well...not really, but you've noticed that someone is on the radio transmitting the passkey to their safe across the world! So like any good citizen, you've decided to rob him! Listen out for the clues to each password on the radio by using the left and right keys to change frequency. Then enter the passkey either by clicking on the keypad or typing the numbers on your keyboard

This game was my first game jam game done in my first year of University so it's incredibly basic. However, it was probably some of the most fun I've had making something and playing still makes me laugh to this day.
