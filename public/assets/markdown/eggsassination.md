# Eggsassination
## A game where you wander in search of soldiers, but the controls are ridiculously difficult.

Eggsassination was a game created in 3 weeks from a randomly generated brief. Having been generated "A game where you wander in search of soldiers, but the controls are ridiculously difficult." my team found a way to twist this by interpret "soldiers" as pieces of toast in Egg and Soldiers. So we created a game where you play as an egg rolling around, looking for soldiers. Due to the shape of eggs, rolling around came under the "ridiculously difficult" controls requirement.

This small project eventually became the inspiration for my first commercial project: Shell Corp
